    "### 1. Algorithm\n",
    "The whole algorithm is based on ROS system. There are three main parts.\n",
    "1. waypoint updater node \n",
    "2. traffic light state process node\n",
    "3. drive by wire node. \n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Issues with udacity original repository \n",
    "- I think in system integration project the message type 'float32 steering_wheel_angle_cmd' should be change into 'float32 steering_wheel_cmd' . Because I think as link shows there is no message named with 'float32 steering_wheel_angle_cmd' (refer to [this link](https://bitbucket.org/DataspeedInc/dbw_mkz_ros/src/default/dbw_mkz_msgs/msg/SteeringReport.msg))\n",
    "\n",
    "- Errors as below : \n",

    "  \n",
    "### 3. Results\n",
    "The simulation results shows that algorithm works appropriately. Sometimes I think the PID controller should be tuned more.\n",
    "And is the LOOKAHEAD_WP set too large, then in s curve geometry, the vehicle's path becomes strange. As a result, vehicle controller can't work well. In my case, my vehicle ran out of the track.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Other things to do\n",
    "- Recognize the traffic light like in real world\n",
    "- Combine the code in to carla which is real car in udacity\n",
    "- Figure out the compuation load.\n",
    "- Optimization should be done in path planning.\n",

    "# Original Udacity introduction\n",
    "This is the project repo for the final project of the Udacity Self-Driving Car Nanodegree: Programming a Real Self-Driving Car. For more information about the project, see the project introduction [here](https://classroom.udacity.com/nanodegrees/nd013/parts/6047fe34-d93c-4f50-8336-b70ef10cb4b2/modules/e1a23b06-329a-4684-a717-ad476f0d8dff/lessons/462c933d-9f24-42d3-8bdc-a08a5fc866e4/concepts/5ab4b122-83e6-436d-850f-9f4d26627fd9).\n",

    "Please use **one** of the two installation options, either native **or** docker installation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Native Installation\n",
    "\n",
    "* Be sure that your workstation is running Ubuntu 16.04 Xenial Xerus or Ubuntu 14.04 Trusty Tahir. [Ubuntu downloads can be found here](https://www.ubuntu.com/download/desktop).\n",

    "  * 2 CPU\n",
    "  * 2 GB system memory\n",
    "  * 25 GB of free hard drive space\n",
    "\n",
    "  The Udacity provided virtual machine has ROS and Dataspeed DBW already installed, so you can skip the next two steps if you are using this.\n",

    "* Follow these instructions to install ROS\n",
    "  * [ROS Kinetic](http://wiki.ros.org/kinetic/Installation/Ubuntu) if you have Ubuntu 16.04.\n",
    "  * [ROS Indigo](http://wiki.ros.org/indigo/Installation/Ubuntu) if you have Ubuntu 14.04.\n",
    "* [Dataspeed DBW](https://bitbucket.org/DataspeedInc/dbw_mkz_ros)\n",
    "  * Use this option to install the SDK on a workstation that already has ROS installed: [One Line SDK Install (binary)](https://bitbucket.org/DataspeedInc/dbw_mkz_ros/src/81e63fcc335d7b64139d7482017d6a97b405e250/ROS_SETUP.md?fileviewer=file-view-default)\n",
